    "- Edge detection is a tool than identifies points in a digital image at which the image brightness changes sharply or has discontinuites.\n",
    "- Edge detection is import tool in computer vision especially for feature extraction/detection.\n",

    "### SOBEL\n",
    "- Sobel edge detector is a gradient based method.\n",
    "- It works with first order derivatives. It calculate the first of the image separately for X and Y axes.\n",
    "- The solbe uses two 3x3 kernels which are convolved with original image to calculates the derivates.\n",
    "- For image A, Gx and Gy are image representing horizontal and vertical derivate aproximations:\n",
